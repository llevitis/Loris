# Data Integrity Flag

The Data Integrity Flag module provides at-a-glance information on behavioural feedback issues, and provides a tool for users to view and update behavioural feedback directly without navigating through timepoints, instruments and other feedback modules. 

The Data Integrity Flag module has two tabs: “Browse”, and “Update”. The Browse tab allows users to search for existing feedback for a particular “Visit Label”, “Instrument”, “User”, and “Flag Status”. The Update tab allows users to manually update the integrity status of an instrument.

**Browse tab**

Use the Selection Filters to search for existing feedback for a particular “Visit Label”, “Instrument”, and “User”. As the user specifies search criteria, the data table results below will update dynamically.  

**Update**

To update the integrity flag status of an instrument, users must input the Visit Label, Instrument, Date, and new Flag Status which are all required fields, indicated by red asterisks. Optionally, users may add additional comments in the textbox provided. To finalize an update, users must click “Update”.

Within the results table, links in blue text under the "Instrument" column will redirect the users to the Data Team Helper module, which displays a detailed summary of each field for that particular instrument along with links to behavioural feedback and to incomplete candidates. Users can also view the date the flag was submitted, the “Flag Status”, any comments, data cleaning feedback, and “UserID”. Note, Flag Status is based on the codes used in the dropdown menu of the selection filter, where 1 = “Ready for Review”, 2 = “Review Completed”, 3 = “Feedbacks Closed”, and 4 = “Finalization”.
